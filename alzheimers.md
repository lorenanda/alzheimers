## EDA
- There are three group categories of patients, the most common being Nondemented.
  
### Demographics
- In this sample there are 190 nondemented, 146 demented, and 37 converted patients.
- men , women
- Demented patients are on average 76 years old â€“ younger than nondemented and converted patients.
- Demented patients have less years of education (on average 13 years) than the other two groups.
- Demented patients have the highest socioeconomic status (2.7) of the three groups (2.3 for nondemented, 1.7 for converted).

### Pathology
- Men also have a higher estimated intracranial volume (eTIV) than women, in all groups. The nondemented patients have the highest eTIV, presumably because the dementia causes the shrinkage of brain tissue.
- Across groups, women have a higher normalized whole brain volume (nWBV) than men. The nondemented patients have the highest nWBV, since the brain is not affected by the disease.
